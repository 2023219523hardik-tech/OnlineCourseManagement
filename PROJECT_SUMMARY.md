# Online Course Management System (OCMS) - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Online Course Management System (OCMS) is a comprehensive Spring Boot application that demonstrates advanced software engineering concepts including module-based architecture, custom data structures, and modern web development practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Module-Based Development
The application is structured into four main modules:

1. **User Management Module** (`com.ocms.user`)
   - User registration, authentication, and authorization
   - Role-based access control (STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, ADMIN)
   - JWT token-based security
   - HashMap implementation for user caching

2. **Course Management Module** (`com.ocms.course`)
   - CRUD operations for courses and modules
   - Student enrollment management
   - LinkedList implementation for module sequencing
   - Course content organization

3. **Assignment Management Module** (`com.ocms.assignment`)
   - Assignment creation and management
   - Submission handling with deadline prioritization
   - Grading system with feedback
   - PriorityQueue implementation for submission processing

4. **Reporting Module** (`com.ocms.reporting`)
   - Analytics and performance reports
   - Student progress tracking
   - Course completion statistics
   - TreeMap implementation for chronological data

## 📊 Data Structures Implemented

### 1. LinkedList (`com.ocms.common.datastructures.LinkedList`)
- **Purpose**: Manage course modules in sequential order
- **Features**: 
  - Add/remove elements at beginning and end
  - Index-based access
  - Iterator support
  - Dynamic resizing
- **Usage**: Course modules are stored in LinkedList to maintain proper learning sequence

### 2. HashMap (`java.util.HashMap`)
- **Purpose**: Cache user data and course enrollments
- **Features**:
  - O(1) average case lookup
  - Key-value storage
  - Automatic resizing
- **Usage**: 
  - User cache for quick access
  - Course enrollment mapping
  - Reduces database queries

### 3. PriorityQueue (`com.ocms.common.datastructures.PriorityQueue`)
- **Purpose**: Handle assignment submissions based on deadlines
- **Features**:
  - Custom comparator support
  - Priority-based ordering
  - Efficient insertion and removal
- **Usage**: Assignment submissions are prioritized by due date

### 4. TreeMap (`java.util.TreeMap`)
- **Purpose**: Generate reports sorted by dates
- **Features**:
  - Natural ordering by keys
  - Sorted map implementation
  - Efficient range queries
- **Usage**: Activity logging and time-series analytics

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### JWT Authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Stateless session management
- Role-based authorization
- Secure password encoding with BCrypt

### Role-Based Access Control
- **STUDENT**: Enroll in courses, submit assignments, view progress
- **INSTRUCTOR**: Create/manage courses, create assignments, grade submissions
- **ADMIN**: Full system access including user management and reporting

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table
users (id, username, email, password, role, first_name, last_name, created_at, updated_at, is_active)

-- Courses table
courses (id, title, description, instructor_id, created_at, updated_at, is_active)

-- Modules table
modules (id, module_title, content, module_order, course_id, created_at, updated_at)

-- Course enrollments
course_enrollments (id, course_id, student_id, enrolled_at, status, completion_percentage)

-- Assignments table
assignments (id, title, description, course_id, due_date, max_score, created_at, updated_at, is_active)

-- Submissions table
submissions (id, assignment_id, user_id, content, submitted_on, score, feedback, is_graded)
```
